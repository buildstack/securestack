Hi this is Paul with SecureStack.  I'm proud to announce that SecureStack is now generally available in *all* AWS regions including the US GovCloud.  SecureStack is a Platform security as a service.  What that means is that you can secure your AWS cloud resources in just a few minutes with SecureStack.  SecureStack has 3 mains pieces to it:
1. We build hardened linux operating systems that meet CIS and PCI compliance specifications.  You can use our hardened linux to build all your AWS ec2 instances.  Databases, web servers, application servers, caching and proxy servers can all use SecureStack Base hardened operating systems.  Especially anything that needs to be public facing.  You want to make sure that you are building on top of a hardened OS when things will be open to the internet.  
2. Our SecureStack Platform Server is a SIEM and central logging solution.  All your instances that are built with SecureStack Base will talk to your SecureStack Platform Server sending all data and metrics to it in real time.  SecureStack will alert you to any issues or security events in your AWS infrastructure.  
3. Finally, SecureStack includes an integration layer.  Security tools are baked right into the platform and the integration layer handles the communication and configuration that makes it all work together.  If you add software to a SecureStack Base instance like Apache, Tomcat or VPN, SecureStack sees the new services automatically.  Logs are automatically captured and sent to the SIEM server and the services themselves are hardened and protected.  

Today we are going to install SecureStack Platform Server.  This is the system that will manage all your AWS SecureSTack Base instances.  You can find our products at https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=040c3d94-af50-430e-85a0-03719a4f9fad.  Let's click on SecrueSTack Server.  You can click on continue which will launch the AWS console, where you can log in and continue installing SecureStack Platform Server.  Alternately, if you are already logged into the AWS console you can browse to the ec2 service, then click on launch instance and then select AWS Marketplace on the left hand side.  Search for SecureStack and choose SecureStack Server.

Before we go any further we will need 3 things before we continue:
1. AWS VPC subnet CIDR. This is called your "local_net".  This is where all your SecureStack instances will be built.
2. Security group that allows ssh (tcp22) and http (tcp80) 
3. The IPs of any systems that you want to allow access to this SecureSTack server.  This is called your "white_list"
